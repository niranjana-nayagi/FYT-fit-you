The /my_flutter_app/my_flutter_app/ios directory is typically generated automatically when you create a new Flutter project. It contains platform-specific files and configurations for iOS. Since you requested the contents of the ios directory, it is generally not meant to have a specific file structure or contents defined manually. Therefore, I will indicate that this directory is intentionally left blank.

# /my_flutter_app/my_flutter_app/ios
# This directory is intentionally left blank.
